            some really long
            text that
            will probably
            need to be
            scrolled if you
            try to view it
            on a small terminal.
            or, you could just make the
            ttermainal bigger.
            that is what
            is nice about 4k screens,
            you can get a lot of text on them.
            either way, this is
            an example of some text that
            may, or may not, need to be
            scrolled and it was created
            to test the scrolling
            feature for an info
            text box.

            second verse, same as the first...
